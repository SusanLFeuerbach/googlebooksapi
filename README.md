To make this work, you have to form a querystring after the URL and include that in your hyperlinks.

Example: Instead of linking just to index.html, you would link to index.html?0345803655

In line for isbn infor, delete the isbn number, than replace with a var [queryString].
We also added to end of URL "html?isbn=0307575853 during the creation of the code.

Added CSS at home after class. Could not get css.less to work.
